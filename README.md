# django_svelte_jwt_auth

This is the codebase that follows the series of tutorials on building a [FullStack JWT Authentication and Authorization System with Django and SvelteKit][1].

This project was deployed on heroku (backend) and vercel (frontend) and its live version can be accessed [here][2].

To run this application locally, you need to run both the `backend` and `frontend` projects. While the latter has some instructions already for spinning it up, the former can be spinned up following the instructions below.

## Run locally

To run locally

- Clone this repo:
  ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sirneij/django_svelte_jwt_auth.git
  ```
- Change directory into the `backend` folder:
  ```
   cd backend
  ```
- Create a virtual environment:

  ```
   pipenv shell
  ```

  You might opt for other dependencies management tools such as `virtualenv`, `poetry`, or `venv`. It's up to you.

- Install the dependencies:
  ```
  pipenv install
  ```
- Make migrations and migrate the database:
  ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
  ```
- Finally, run the application:
  ```
   python manage.py runserver
  ```
